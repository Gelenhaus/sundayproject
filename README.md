This is a refactoring assignment for the University of Utah coding bootcamp. This is our first assignment. 
The goal of this assignment was to consolidate redunadant css code, add semantic html elements, fix broken
links, demonstrate the ability to push to github, deploy a website using github pages, and follow best 
practices outlined in our daily work.
